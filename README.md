# RPS Challenge

#### Adam's Notes

* User stories covered (name is not 'in lights')
* Two player implemented
* Lizard and Spock included
* I have tried to add some graphical polish, but don't know enough
* Some methods are a bit long, 8-9 lines
* I think all classes/tests are isolated
* Don't know HTML style conventions, rubocop doesn't tell me about offences
